If you use their app the booking results in cheaper points for the room. You have 24 hours prior to cancel with no fee and they return the points to your card. We have used them for vacation and my husband drives a truck so on the fly it is super easy if he needs a room for the night to see what is available and use our points. We haven't had an issue with Marriott hotels. We never book through a 3rd party.\n",

I had talked to several front desk staff members prior to our stay and asked about room types. Carmen and Lisa were so nice and accommodating. Most reviews on Trip Advisor were positive and we looked forward to our first stay there. When we arrived on Friday, April 5, Pam, the manager, greeted us. WOW! She has the brightest smile and the personality to go with it! She was working at the hotel for all five days of our stay. She was always smiling, and even when things got stressful at the front desk, she was pleasant. Haley is another staff member who is at the top of our list of people to comment on. She had a smile for every person! Housekeeping staff were also professional and pleasant. We had a King Suite, which is one of the nicest room types that we have stayed in.\n",

Despite the hotel being advertised as a Marriott Bonvoy partner, we encountered numerous issues that significantly detracted from our experience. Firstly, the hotel staff, with the exception of Omar and Betty, were unhelpful and unprofessional. They refused to recognize our Marriott Bonvoy membership, despite the booking being made through Concur, our company's travel agency. This led to unnecessary charges, such as an early check-in fee and a fee for a basic room upgrade, which is atypical for Marriott properties.\n",

Floors were dirty and sticky, no hooks in bathroom to hang clothes or towels and no exhaust fan. Lighting in bathroom was very dim with no way of making it brighter. You have to pay for parking each time you leave the parking garage. That adds up quickly if you come and go a few times. Strongly feel the hotel should provide free parking since they charge enough for the rooms. The hotel only had 1 restaurant (other one closed after renovations) and did not provide a good selection. Food was decent but overpriced. Had to have bed mattress replaced due to feeling the springs. Took over 2 hrs for this to be swapped out.

After experiencing how the chain processes their transactions against a customers card, one to which they deny but has been verified with my bank. They send an authorization request to your bank upon check in and instead of using that same authorization number to process the charges when you check out, they submit a second authorization request to your bank for the final charges. Resulting in duplicate amount of charges frozen on your account,( if using a debit/bank card) until your bank receives the charges to one if the two authorizations they gave to the hotel. Now, I have experienced the hotel moving my reservation which was booked in advance and charging me the rate of the day which was $800 more than the rate originally booked.\n",

Floors were dirty and sticky, no hooks in bathroom to hang clothes or towels and no exhaust fan. Lighting in bathroom was very dim with no way of making it brighter. You have to pay for parking each time you leave the parking garage. That adds up quickly if you come and go a few times. Strongly feel the hotel should provide free parking since they charge enough for the rooms. The hotel only had 1 restaurant (other one closed after renovations) and did not provide a good selection. Food was decent but overpriced. Had to have bed mattress replaced due to feeling the springs. Took over 2 hrs for this to be swapped out. Don't feel we'll be staying at any Marriott's anytime soon.\n",

First, did you know that you can only leave a review for your Marriott hotel on their website if Marriott invites you to leave a review? If you complain at the hotel about any issues, it is unlikely you will get invited to leave a review. Even as a newer hotel, this hotel website only gets a 4.2. Some lesser reviews must have squeaked through!\n",

After experiencing how the chain processes their transactions against a customers card, one to which they deny but has been verified with my bank. They send an authorization request to your bank upon check in and instead of using that same authorization number to process the charges when you check out, they submit a second authorization request to your bank for the final charges.

The best they could do was put me on a phone with a rude manager who suggested I walk away from my non refundable booking and go to another hotel. I finally had my dad find my id and stop it off.

      "Review: Yes, we booked a nonrefundable stay at Georgetown Marriott expecting to witness the Inauguration of Kamala Harris. We paid an outrageous $1000 per night as few reservations were available through the area and proximity was a priority for medical concerns. We asked for a check in dates or a transfer to another Marriott in the future. We will be out $3000 plus tax and other fees. Obviously, others interested in the 2025 Inauguration will be seeking Marriott accommodations. This would be a win/win for all concerned. Marriott makes more money, a Republican family takes the booking and my family keeps their loyalty as Marriott Bonvoy members.\n",
