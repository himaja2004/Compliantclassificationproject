## Features

1. **Data Collection**: 
   - Customer reviews were collected using web scraping with Selenium.
   - The dataset includes reviews, ratings, customer details, and other metadata.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Text cleaning, stop word removal, and lemmatization were applied.
   - Reviews were tokenized and converted into structured formats for analysis.

3. **Topic Modeling**:
   - Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) were used for extracting topics from reviews.

4. **Multi-label Classification**:
   - Reviews were categorized into multiple complaint types: 
     - Product-related
     - Service-related
     - Payment-related
     - Technical issues
   - TF-IDF features were used for feature extraction.
   - Models implemented: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Classifier, and Multinomial Naive Bayes.

5. **Evaluation**:
   - Metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score were evaluated for each classifier.
   - Hyperparameter tuning was performed using GridSearchCV.
